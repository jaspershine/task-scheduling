# CS 170 Project Fall 2021

Take a look at the project spec before you get started!

Requirements:

Python 3.6+

Files:
- `parse.py`: functions to read/write inputs and outputs
- `solver.py`: where you should be writing your code to solve inputs
- `Task.py`: contains a class that is useful for processing inputs





## To run the algorithm on all inputs, simply run:

python3 solver.py


### To run the algorithm on one file:

- comment out the section that says TO RUN THE CODE ON ALL INPUTS (lines 151-163)
- uncomment lines 172-173
- replace the string on line 172 with the filepath
